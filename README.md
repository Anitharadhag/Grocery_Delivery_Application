# Grocery_Delivery_Application
A grocery delivery application is a Web application that allows users to order grocery products and deliver them at home. 
They are an online platform for retailers to gain more business by offering their services in the comfort of your customer's home, at work, or even on the go.
It saves people time and money because they don't have to travel into town or order takeaways anymore! This can be useful when you live in remote areas that don't offer much variety in grocery shopping options.
